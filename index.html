	  <h2 class="script leading">case studies</h2>
	  <p class="smleading">Below are my favorite case studies I've worked on, either on my own or with a group of people. I work best in the design aspect of each project and enjoy interpreting research to get users the best product possible. Through each step of the process, I think about what the user wants and what would make the end product more beneficial—confirming designs through testing, interviews, and research.</p>

	<h3 class="script leading">packit: app onbording</h3>
	<p class="smleading">This student project was a case study in travel apps, and while looking into how people prepare for travel, we discovered people found packing for travel anxiety-provoking.

		<h5>UX Case Study</h5>
		<h3 class="script leading">pet caravan: <br />application concept</h3>
		<p class="smleading">This student project was a mobile app my group and I designed for busy pet owners to chauffeur their pets to and from their home, appointments, play dates, and more when they can't. We interviewed pet owners on their comfortability with having a rideshare-type app for pets and feelings on rideshare apps. After gathering information, we saw a market gap for an app that would provide this service for pet owners. This mid-fidelity prototype was the result of the research.</p>
